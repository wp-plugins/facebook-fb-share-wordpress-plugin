Adds a Facebook Share button to your WordPress posts

== Description ==

FB Share is a WordPress Plugin, which lets you add a Facebook Share button for your WordPress posts, together with the total number of share.

###Usage###

There are three ways you can add the facebook share button. Automatic way, manual way and using shortcodes

#### Automatic way

Install the Plugin and choose the type and position of the button from the Pluginâ€™s settings page. You can also specifically enable/disable the button for each post or page from the write post/page screen.

#### Manual way

If you want more control over the way the button should be positioned, then you can manually call the button using the following code.

if (function_exists('fbshare_button')) echo fbshare_button();

#### Using shortcodes

You can also place the shortcode [fbshare] anywhere in your post. This shortcode will be replaced by the button when the post is rendered.
